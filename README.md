# dedupe-dcp

This is an experiment in using the dedupe package to flag duplicate records in data managed by the Capital Planning team. For more information on the package, [view the docs](https://dedupe.io/developers/library/en/latest/) or the [package repo](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe). There is also a repo with [usage examples](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples). These examples were modified and tested on the Facilities Database.
